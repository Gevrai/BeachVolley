Play on itch.io: https://gejo.itch.io/beach-volley

It's a bad game of volleyball on a beach, based on an old flash web game that I vaguely remember playing a long while ago, but I have no idea what it was.

First godot 4 project, with 'original' pixel 'art'! Yes it's ugly, but its mine.

The project is a complete mess (architecture, code, art, music, sound), almost by choice. Trying to get in the habit of prototyping and not over-engineering things FOR NO REASON, and just getting things [#done](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13)

# How to play

Player 1: W/A/D
Player 2: Up/Left/Right arrows

Press 'up' to squash, and release to jump. It's unwieldy, I know, I just found it cute how characters squash when ready to jump.

If one of the two side hasn't moved yet, a [highly sophisticated AI](/AIPlayer.gd) will play instead, until said player moves.

Game end when closed, whichever player has the most point has won. Good job, they deserved it (especially if they were against the AI).
