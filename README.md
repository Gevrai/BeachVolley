Play on itch.io: https://gejo.itch.io/beach-volley

It's a bad game of volleyball on a beach, based on an old flash web game that I vaguely remember playing a long while ago, but I have no idea what it was.

First godot 4 project, with 'original' pixel 'art'! Yes it's ugly, but its mine.

# How to play

Player 1: WAD
Player 2: Up/Left/Right arrows

Press 'up' to squash, and release to jump. It's unwieldy, I know, I just found it cute how characters squash when ready to jump.

Game end when closed, whichever player has the most point has won. Good job, they deserved it.
